Add team expense tracking. Admins and treasurers can log, edit, and delete team expenses across five categories (fields, equipment, travel, tournaments, other) via a new `/teams/:teamId/finances/expenses` page. The Finances overview gains a new default "Overview" tab with an income vs. expense balance dashboard — KPI strip for income, expenses, and net balance, plus a category breakdown — driven by a multi-currency `balance-summary` endpoint. Every write is captured in an `expense_history` audit table via a Postgres trigger. Reuses existing `finance:view` (read) and `finance:manage_fees` (write) permissions — no new permission literal.
