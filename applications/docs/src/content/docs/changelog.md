## 2026-04 — Configurable reminders

- Reminders are now fully configurable per team. You can set how many days before an event the reminder fires, what time of day (evaluated in the team's timezone), and which Discord channel receives it.
- Reminders and event-start announcements now go to a dedicated **reminders channel** you configure in Team settings. If no channel is set, the bot falls back to the event's owner-group channel.
- Reminders and start announcements now @-mention the Discord role linked to the event's member group, so only the players who actually need to respond are notified.
- When an event starts, the bot posts a fresh **"Starting now"** announcement to the reminders channel with the going list and a role mention — in addition to updating the original event embed.

## 2026-04 — Documentation site launched

- New `/docs` site with role-based quick starts, guides, FAQ, and API overview.
- English content is the source of truth. Czech translations fall back to English with a notice and will be added page-by-page.
